A page built with Python and html/CSS that plays the trailers of the movies. 


## To Change Movies

- You can change and rename any of the movie objects created to which ever you please, for each movie object 
changing the name, description, poster img link, trailer link.
- Add at the bottom of the entertainmnet_center.py in the movies list your movie or swap out the ones you 
replaced.
- fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page(movies) will generate a new html file in the main directory

Happy Trailer-ing! :)
